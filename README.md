## Overview

gapminderExplore provides users with tools for analyzing and visualizing findings from the Gapminder dataset, and our goal is to enhance your ability to create powerful visualizations and analyses from your dataset using R. We have included many useful functions within the gapminderExplore package, including those for filtering countries, summarizing life expectancy, exploring GDP per capita trends, and developing your custom S3 class (gme_data). The gapminderExplore package was created to serve as a project demonstrating package development, documentation, S3 methods, testing, and creating vignettes.
