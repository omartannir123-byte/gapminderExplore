## Overview

`gapminderExplore` is an R package designed to help users analyze and visualize trends in the classic Gapminder dataset. It includes functions to filter countries, summarize life expectancy, explore GDP-per-capita trends, and work with a small custom S3 class (`gme_data`). This package was developed as part of a final project demonstrating package development, documentation, S3 methods, testing, and vignette creation.
